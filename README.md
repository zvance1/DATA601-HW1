DATA 601 Homework 1

# Overview and Goals
For this project, I chose to perform data analysis on Baltimore City crime data.  The motivation in exploring this data is to find patterns and trends in crimes so that we may learn more information and be better prepared to stop crime.  We could even run some predictive analytics on the data to predict where/when/how a crime might happen next.  As a result, police officers may be stationed at those specific places at the time crime is expected, and be looking for signs of the type of crime expected to happen.  If they are aware that it will happen before it does, the goal is that they can prevent it before it happens.

To perform this analysis, I will use a data set named "BPD Part 1 Victim Based Crime Data" from Open Baltimore (Here: https://data.baltimorecity.gov/Public-Safety/BPD-Part-1-Victim-Based-Crime-Data/wsfq-mvij/data).  This data is updated every Monday, with a 9 day time lag to minimize changes to the data as records move throughout the BPD review process.  I exported this data as a CSV file and began the cleaning of it from there.

# How to Navigate
The data in its CSV format is located in the data directory of this repository.  Also in this directory is the csv I wrote after cleaning the data.  In the notebooks repository you will find two jupyter notebooks - one for the loading and cleaning of the data, and one for the exploring of the data.  Python3 is used to run the code in these files with the most up to date packages from anaconda as of September 14, 2020.
